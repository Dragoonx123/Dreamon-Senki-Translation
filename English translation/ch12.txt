Starting NG+ with recruitable female characters.**
Note: When a succubus attacks a female, the
dialogue will be the same as if they were
attacking a man.
Similarly, the dialogue of a female character
attacked by a succubus won't provide any yuri
dialogue, and will appear as if fighting a man.
Please forgive me.

In addition to these rewards, you can also
start the game (NG+) with the same levels and
equipment of the units you've cleared.
